Here are a few tips I feel very useful in writing python library in my work.

Data architecture

Design Patterns:
1. The singleton pattern
2. The factory pattern
   Introduction

```python
class BaseData:
    def __init__(self, )
```
3. The template method pattern
4. The decrator pattern
  



My extensions:
---------------

1. Python
2. Sublime Material Theme
3. autoDocstring
   Used to highlight #TODO
4. Markdown All in One

My settings.json:
---------------------
```python

```
    
There are still some features lacking in VSCode, like make unused package grey, keep appropriate indent when copying a block of code, etc. But certainly VSCode gives a fresh feeling of writing code and very extendable.
